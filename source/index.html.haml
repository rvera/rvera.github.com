          Hi there!
        %p.lead
          Thanks for stopping by. Here you'll find some of my personal projects I've worked on over the years.

          %h2 Image Picker
          %p
            Image Picker is a simple jQuery plugin that transforms a select element into a more user-friendly graphical interface.
          %h3 Check it out!

          %h2 EDIPS: an Easy to Deploy Indoor Positioning System
          %p
            I'm what you might call a prehistoric mobile developer. I used to develop
            applications for the Java Micro Edition, Blackberry and Windows Mobile platforms
            in a time when those platforms where actually relevant.
            EDIPS is the offspring of the knowledge I had with my passion at the time for
            indoor positioning systems. I'd love to work on a similar project now, the technology
            is much closer to the point of making a tool like this a reality.
            %br
            %br
            While similar applications exists, none of them are very practical when it comes to
            actually deploying them in the real world. EDIPS sacrifices some accuracy in order to
            actually make the initial deployment as fast as possible.

                The app builds a manet with the current users in the area and 
                shares your position with the rest of the users on the environment.
            %li.span3

            %li.span3
              %p.muted
                The app takes advantage of the motion sensors on the device and communicates
                to other users whether you are still or moving around. It also uses this 
                information to make better guessings about your current position.

          %h2 Jumping Cat Adventures
          %p
            This a game I made a long time ago for my sisters.
            They were the best QA I ever had, seriously. It's a game that while challenging
            you can't really die on it. It also employs a very simplistic one button contol method;
            just point in the direction where you want to jump and hold the mouse button, the 
            longer you hold it the stronger the jump will be.
            %br
            %br
            The game was built using GameMaker so it only works on Windows. It should 
            still work on modern machine but can't say for sure. Haven't used a Windows
            machine in a long, long, time.

            I did most of the programming and my girlfriend at the time helped
            me with the pixel art. We even won a contest with this game but I'm still waiting
            for my first place prize, the sponsoring game company never gave it to me (if someone
            from Wanako Studios/Behaviour Santiago is reading this, it's never too late!)
          %h3 It even has an awesome trailer!
