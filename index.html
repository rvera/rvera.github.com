              Image Picker is a simple jQuery plugin that transforms a select element into a more
              user-friendly graphical interface. I found myself using 'select' form elements a lot despite
              not really liking them that much; They don't either present all the available options in
              a good way nor are very user friendly on mobile devices (radio buttons are not really better).
              This plugin was created to solve both of these problems, so far it works very well and seems
              to well received by the web developer community.

              I'm what you might call a prehistoric mobile developer. I used to develop
              applications for the Java Micro Edition, Blackberry and Windows Mobile platforms
              in a time when those platforms where actually relevant.
              EDIPS is the offspring of the knowledge I had with my passion at the time for
              indoor positioning systems. I'd love to work on a similar project now, the technology
              is much closer to the point of making a tool like this a reality.
              <br>
              <br>
              While similar applications exists, none of them are very practical when it comes to
              actually deploying them in the real world. EDIPS sacrifices some accuracy in order to
              actually make the initial deployment as fast as possible.

              This a game I made a long time ago for my sisters.
              They were the best QA I ever had, seriously. It's a game that while challenging
              you can't really die on it. It also employs a very simplistic one button contol method;
              just point in the direction where you want to jump and hold the mouse button, the
              longer you hold it the stronger the jump will be.
              <br>
              <br>
              The game was built using GameMaker so it only works on Windows. It should
              still work on modern machine but can't say for sure. Haven't used a Windows
              machine in a long, long, time.
              <br>
              <br>
              I did most of the programming and my girlfriend at the time helped
              me with the pixel art. We even won a contest with this game but I'm still waiting
              for my first place prize, the sponsoring game company never gave it to me (if someone
              from Wanako Studios/Behaviour Santiago is reading this, it's never too late!)

                This is a small proof of concept game that I made while learning C++,
